# Dive
Dive is a 2048-like blending additive and multiplicative number theory,
invented by [Allen Knutson](https://www.google.com/+AllenKnutson) and others
and implemented first by [TheMoreYouKnow](https://github.com/themoreyouknow).

If you're reading this, you probably already know what 2048 is, so forgive me for keeping this short.
